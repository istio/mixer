# Using the API

The Mixer exposes three gRPC methods: `Check`, `Report`, and `Quota`.
All three methods use a consistent request style consisting of three
pieces of state:

- *Request Identification*. An integer generated by the caller
that uniquely identifies the particular request. This value is
returned by the mixer in the response message which makes it
possible for the caller to correlate incoming responses with
the original requests it sent out.

- *Facts*. A map of name/value pairs describing a set of known
facts discovered and/or known by the caller. These facts are
processed by the mixer to produce labels with which policy
and telemetry routing operate.

- *Arguments*. The operation-specific arguments for the call.

## Checking Preconditions

Service preconditions are used to restrict access
by a service consumer to a service's facilities.
For example, a service may need to ensure the caller
is on a whitelist or not on a blacklist, or that the caller
has valid credentials, etc.

The Istio mixer provides a simple `Check` call used to verify
preconditions. The results of a precondition check are highly
cachable and mixer clients are expected to do so for best
performance. The infrastructure is designed to facilitate this.

Once you have published a managed service, you can call the
`Check` method for the service without additional configuration.
The following example shows the shape of a request to perform a
single check:

TBD

The response from the `Check` method indicates whether the check succeeded.

## Reporting Logs

The Istio mixer can be used to send logs to both service producers and service consumers.
The mixer accepts structured or unstructured log data, which it batches
and forwards to the appropriate configured monitoring
backend such as 'Stackdriver Logging'.

Whereas `Stackdriver Logging` and similar systems allow a service to produce logs for
the sake of the service's producer, the Istio mixer also lets you
produce logs that are intended for the service consumers.
This makes it possible for service consumers to understand and diagnose their
use of the service.

Before you send logs to the mixer, you need to specify three different
bits of information in your service configuration:

* **Log names**: You can have one or more distinct logs. Each log is identified
by a unique name. Individual logs make it possible for you to isolate
distinct types of data if it makes the data easier to visualize or use.

* **Monitored resources**:
Monitored Resources
control the shape of the data that is held within a given log.

* **Log configuration**: Lets you specify the monitored resource associated
with any log stream and the destination (producer or consumer) where each
log should be sent.

In the following example of service configuration state, the log
`activity_log` is configured to be sent to the service consumer.

    # The monitored resource to be used.
    monitored_resources:
    - name: api
      labels:
      - key: cloud.googleapis.com/location
      - key: serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api_version
      - key: serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api_method
      - key: cloud.googleapis.com/project
      - key: cloud.googleapis.com/service

    # The log name to be used.
    logs:
    - name: activity_log

    # The logging configuration.
    logging:
      consumer_destinations:
      - monitored_resource: api
        logs:
        - activity_log

Once you have configured logs in the service configuration
you can call the mixer's `Report` API to record log entries.
The following example shows the shape of a request reporting a
single log entry.

## Reporting Metrics

The Istio mixer can be used to
produce monitoring data to send to service producers and service
consumers. Monitoring provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and
overall health of individual services.

The mixer accepts metrics, which it batches
and aggregates and forwards to the appropriate configured monitoring
backend such as 'Stackdriver Monitoring'.

Whereas `Stackdriver Monitorring` and similar systems allow a service to
produce monitoring data for the sake of the service's producer, the Istio mixer is
designed to also produce monitoring data which is intended for the service's consumers.
This makes it possible for service consumers to understand and diagnose use
of the service.

Before you send monitoring data to the mixer, you need to specify three
different bits of information in your service configuration:

* **Metric names**: You can report one or more metrics. Each metric represents
a single piece of state whose value is tracked over time.

* **Monitored resources**: A Monitored Resource
represents an entity that originates some monitoring data or is the subject
of it.

* **Monitoring configuration**: Lets you specify the metrics associated with
individual monitored resources and the destination (producer or consumer) where
the monitoring data should be sent.

In the following example of service configuration state, we define a
monitored resource and a metric. A client can invoke the `Report`
method to report values on the metric.

    # The monitored resource to be used.
    monitored_resources:
    - name: api
      labels:
      - key: cloud.googleapis.com/location
      - key: serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api_version
      - key: serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api_method
      - key: cloud.googleapis.com/project
      - key: cloud.googleapis.com/service
      - key: cloud.googleapis.com/uid

    # The metrics to be used.
    metrics:
    - name: serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/consumer/request_count
      metric_kind: DELTA
      value_type: INT64
      labels:
      - key: cloud.googleapis.com/day_of_week

    # The monitoring configuration.
    monitoring:
      producer_destinations:
      - monitored_resource: api
        metrics:
        - serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/consumer/request_count
      consumer_destinations:
      - monitored_resource: api
        metrics:
        - serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/consumer/request_count

Once you have configured metrics in the service configuration, you
can cell the mixer's `Report` method to record metric values.
The following example shows the shape of a request reporting a
single metric.
