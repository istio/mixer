# Community Expectations

The Istio mixer is a community project. Consequently, it is wholly dependent on
its community to provide a productive, friendly and collaborative environment.

The first and foremost goal of the Istio mixer community is to develop technology
that simplifies the task of creating a service by taking responsibility for common
precondition checks, such as quotas and permissions, as well as harvesting and
routing of consumer-oriented telemetry.

A second goal is the creation of a community that fosters easy, agile development
of the mixer. We therefore describe the expectations for members of the Istio mixer
community. This document is intended to be a living one that evolves as the community
evolves via the same PR and code review process that shapes the rest of the
project. It currently covers the expectations of conduct that govern all members
of the community as well as the expectations around code review that govern all
active contributors to the Istio mixer project.

## Code of conduct

The most important expectation of the Istio mixer community is that all members
abide by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
Only by respecting each other can we develop a productive, collaborative community.

## Code reviews

As a community we believe in the [value of code reviews for all contributions](collab.md).
Code reviews increase both the quality and readability of our code base, which
in turn produces high quality software.

However, the code review process can also introduce latency for contributors
and additional work for reviewers that can frustrate both parties.
Consequently, as a community we expect that all active participants in the
community will also be active reviewers.

We ask that active contributors to the project participate in the code review
process in areas where that contributor has expertise. Active contributors are
considered to be anyone who meets any of the following criteria:
   * Sent more than two pull requests (PRs) in the previous one month, or more
   than 20 PRs in the previous year.
   * Filed more than three issues in the previous month, or more than 30 issues
   in the previous 12 months.
   * Commented on more than 5 pull requests in the previous month, or
   more than 50 pull requests in the previous 12 months.
   * Marked any PR as LGTM in the previous month.
   * Have *collaborator* permissions in the Istio mixer github project.

In addition to these community expectations, any community member who wants to
be an active reviewer can also add their name to an *active reviewer* file
(location tbd) which will make them an active reviewer for as long as they
are included in the file.

### Expectations of reviewers: review comments

Because reviewers are often the first points of contact between new members of
the community and can therefore significantly impact the first impression of the
Istio mixer community, reviewers are especially important in shaping the
community. Reviewers are highly encouraged to review the
[code of conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
and are strongly encouraged to go above and beyond the code of conduct to promote a
collaborative and respectful community.

### Expectations of reviewers: review latency

Reviewers are expected to respond in a timely fashion to PRs that are assigned
to them. Reviewers are expected to respond to *active* PRs with reasonable
latency, and if reviewers fail to respond, those PRs may be assigned to other
reviewers.

*Active* PRs are considered those which have a proper CLA (`cla:yes`) label
and do not need rebase to be merged. PRs that do not have a proper CLA, or
require a rebase are not considered active PRs.

## Thanks

Many thanks in advance to everyone who contributes their time and effort to
making the Istio mixer both a successful system as well as a successful community.
The strength of our software shines in the strengths of each individual
community member. Thanks!
