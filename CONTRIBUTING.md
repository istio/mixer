## Contributor license agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, you have to jump a
few legal hurdles.

Please fill out the [Google CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com).

Once you are CLA'ed, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have
signed the CLA can be accepted into the repository. This policy does not
apply to [third_party](third_party/) and [vendor](vendor/).

## Contributing a patch

If you're working on an existing issue, simply respond to the issue and express
interest in working on it. This helps other people know that the issue is
active, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
1. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
1. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a
   Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
1. Fork the repo, develop, and test your changes.
1. Submit a pull request.

## Other documents

We have a [developer's guide](doc/devel/development.md) that outlines everything
you need to know to contribute. If you find something undocumented or incorrect
along the way, please feel free to send a Pull Request.

The [project conventions](doc/devel/conventions.md) explain how we expect things
to named and organized.

Please read about our [collaborative development environment](doc/devel/collaboration.md) for information
on how we're running development for the project.

Please see our [community expectations](doc/devel/community.md) for members
of the Istio mixer community.
