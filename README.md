Mixer provides the foundation of the Istio service mesh
design. It is responsible for insulating Envoy and
Istio-based services from details of the current execution
environment, as well as to implement the control policies
that Istio supports.

Mixer provides three distinct features:

- **Precondition Checking**. Enables callers to verify a number of preconditions before responding to an incoming request from a service consumer. 
Preconditions can include whether the service consumer is properly authenticated, is on the service's whitelist, passes ACL checks, and more.

- **Quota Management**. Enables services to allocate and free quota on a number of dimensions, Quotas are used as a relatively simple resource management 
tool to provide some fairness between service consumers when contending for limited resources.

- **Telemetry Reporting**. Enables services to produce logging, monitoring, tracing and billing streams intended for the service producer itself as well as 
for its consumers.
